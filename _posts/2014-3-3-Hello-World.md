title: Hello (blog) world!

I'm planning to use this space for blogs about my experiences in the realm of science. This will include everything from documentation of R scripts that took me awhile to figure out to reports on some neat science things, to musings on conferences or general sciencey things. See you around!

Regards,

Ben
