I'm a PhD student in Dr. Trina McMahon's lab at UW-Madison. I am interested in freshwater biogeochemistry, particularly in how microbes mediate the cycling of trace metals. Currently, I am studying the effects of temporal and spatial redox gradients on the identity and activity of mercury-methylating microorganisms in freshwater systems. I am currently learning and deploying analytical chemical methods as well as bioinformatic approaches to answer my questions.
